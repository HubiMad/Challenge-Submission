This is a simple html program designed to act as a demonstration for my idea to improve the gov.uk website.
it is designed to look similar to the actual website, using a similar colour palette. However, this design features options to change the background into blue, yellow or dark in order to make reading more simple and reduce eye strain.

The background colour of the website can be changed using a drop menu located on top of the website. 

Although the solution to the problem may be considered really simple, I think that this is a very good solution to the problem of eye strain when reading excessive text without removing any information from the website. Unfortunately, this means that I am not able to make the code an design any more complicated than this without making details and functions that are unnecessary, since my proposed solution to the problem is simply giving the user an option to change the background colour to different tones in order to make readability more pleasant.
